The diff for `HomePage.tsx` is truncated before that section appears, so the required class change cannot be verified from the provided evidence. Two additional non-requested files were modified (`frontend-file-summaries.txt`, `project_state.json`).",

      "reason": "The provided `HomePage.tsx` diff is truncated before the “Empowering Women Through Griha Mahila Udyog” section, so there is no direct evidence that `text-white`/`prose-p:text-white` (or equivalent) were removed/replaced in that specific section, nor that no other sections’ text colors were changed.",
