However, due to truncation, it’s not verifiable from the diff summary that *all* primary boxed content areas on the Home page were updated, nor that no other HomePage boxed areas remain unaffected.",

      "reason": "The diff snippet only clearly shows one boxed section (\"Our Story\") updated with `text-black dark:text-card-foreground`. Because the HomePage diff is truncated, there isn’t sufficient evidence that all main boxed content sections/cards on the Home page received the same treatment (as required by “section(s)” and the AC).",
