  "architectural_notes": [
    "Project structured as an ICP dapp with separate backend (Motoko canister) and frontend (React/Vite) plus generated Candid bindings.",
    "Frontend stack: React + Vite + Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui component set; reusable UI primitives live under build-template/src/frontend/src/components/ui.",
    "Authentication uses Internet Identity via a dedicated hook and actor-creation hook for backend calls.",
    "Static product catalog is currently sourced from frontend code (data/products.ts); cart state is client-side and persisted via a storage utility.",
    "Build-template includes Docker/deploy scaffolding and scripts for generated image resizing/pruning.",
    "\"Other Products\" customization marquee should be placed below the \"Other Products\" heading, with increased size, darker color, and slower scroll speed to ensure visibility in the draft.",
    "\"Other Products\" customization marquee text color should remain white (do not change to grey); adjust visibility via placement/size/speed/contrast in other ways.",

    "The \"Other Products\" scrolling marquee text (\"Quantity can be customized\") was reported as not visible in the draft; likely styling/contrast/placement needs adjustment.",

    "Marquee requirement conflict: prior direction says \"Quantity can be customized\" marquee text must remain white; latest request asks for a darker moving line under Other products—needs clarification/alignment."
