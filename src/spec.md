## Summary
**Goal:** Build a responsive multi-page marketing and catalog website for a thepla brand with a clear home narrative, categorized product sliders, a basic cart, and complete navigation to FAQ and Contact.

**Planned changes:**
- Create routes/pages for Home, Categories, Cart, Notifications, Account, FAQ, and Contact with responsive layouts and cohesive warm food-brand styling (no blue/purple as primary colors).
- Add a header area with in-UI editable brand name and user-uploaded logo (with visible placeholders when unset), reflected across the site during the session.
- Build the Home page narrative flow including a prominent “Brand Story” section (provided text verbatim) plus a dedicated English section explaining the “Griha Mahila Udyog” women-at-home empowerment model, and supporting quality/trust-style sections inspired structurally by the Lijjat Papad site (without copying text/branding).
- Implement a Categories page/section with three categories (Long Duration (3 Months), Short Duration (1 Day), Diet Conscious), each as a horizontal slider/carousel of product cards showing realistic unbranded images, product name, pack size, and ₹ pricing (including the ₹45–₹50 range for Methi Thepla).
- Add an “Other Products” slider/carousel with realistic unbranded images, pack size labels, ₹ pricing where provided (Lime, Mango only), and per-item user-adjustable quantity controls.
- Implement a cart with add-to-cart from product cards, quantity adjustment, remove, line totals, grand total in ₹, and persistence via browser local storage.
- Add a fixed bottom navigation bar on mobile with Home, Categories, Cart, Notification, Account; ensure it navigates correctly, indicates the active page, and doesn’t overlap content.
- Create simple themed placeholder pages for Notifications and Account (no authentication).
- Add an FAQ page with an English accordion covering shelf life, storage, ingredients/no preservatives, delivery/ordering, and women-led production.
- Add a Contact page showing phone number (9785674345), location (Mulund East), plus editable placeholders/fields for Email ID and Instagram handle (no backend).

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse the brand’s story and mission, view products by category and in “Other Products” via sliders with images and ₹ prices, adjust quantities, add/remove items in a cart that persists on refresh, and navigate via bottom tabs to complete pages including FAQ and Contact.
