# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Make the text inside the main boxed content area(s) on the Home page render black in light mode while staying readable in dark mode.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Home page boxed/card content text styling to use a light-mode black text color and an appropriate dark-mode text color for contrast.
- Scope the styling change to the Home page boxed content area(s) only to avoid unintended text color changes elsewhere.

**User-visible outcome:** On the Home page, text inside the primary bordered/rounded content box section(s) appears black in light mode and remains clearly readable in dark mode, with no noticeable text color changes on other pages.
